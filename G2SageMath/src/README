Installation
============

G2SageMath is a portable collection of Python scripts that you do not have to install anything.

A part of the the google-api-python-client library and other dependencies are included in this application, but these libraries have not been installed on your
system. That means that this program will run from within the unzipped directory, but from nowhere else.  

An ambitious user may install the whole gdata-python-client library, but this is not required to run G2SageMath 

The easiest way to install the client library into your system is by running easy_install:

  easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

You might need to add a 'sudo' to the beginning of that command depending on your platform.
If you don't have easy_install you can get it by installing the setuptools package.
