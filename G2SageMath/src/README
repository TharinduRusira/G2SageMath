Running
=======

You can run the application with:

  python run.py
  
Running the test-suite

	add ./src directory to the system path before running the test cases
	
		import sys
		sys.path(./src)
	then run the test module
	
		python Test_g2sagemathlogin
		python Test_g2sagemathdata
  



Installation
============

The full source for the google-api-python-client library is included
in this application, but the library has not been installed on your
system. That means that this program will run from within the unzipped
directory, but from nowhere else.

The easiest way to install the client library into your system is by running easy_install:

  easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

You might need to add a 'sudo' to the beginning of that command depending on your platform.
If you don't have easy_install you can get it by installing the setuptools package.


Documentation
=============

The documentation for the google-api-python-client library is avialable here:

The documentation for G2SageMath will be available soon:
